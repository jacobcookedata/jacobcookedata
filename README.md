### Hello!

I am Jacob, an aspiring data analyst with a background in Physics.
Following my Master's in Physics, I have been exploring all things data and I'm hoping to break into the data industry!

I have been developing my skills in Python and SQL:
 - Pandas for data wrangling
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh for visualisations
 - Querying data using SQL, including complex subqueries and AB testing
