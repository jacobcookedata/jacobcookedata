### Hello!

I'm Jacob, an aspiring data analyst with a background in Physics. I have been exploring all things data after being inspired by my computational physics project during my Master's. I'm hoping to build on my data analysis skills and break into the data industry!

I have been developing my skills in Python and SQL:
 - Pandas for data wrangling
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh for visualisations
 - Querying data using SQL, including complex subqueries and AB testing
